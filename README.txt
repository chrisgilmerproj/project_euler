This is a collection of my work based on problems that can be found at http://projecteuler.net/.  I used the problems to teach myself python and to better understand algorithms.  I highly recommend you try to solve the problems on your own first before looking at my solutions.  Also, please read the forums at Project Euler.  They were of invaluable help in learning how to improve my own code.
