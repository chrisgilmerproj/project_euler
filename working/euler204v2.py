# Problem:  How many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are there
#           which don't exceed 10^9?
#
# Hint:     A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor
#           larger than 5.  So the first few Hamming numbers are
#           1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15.
#
#           There are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 10^8.
#
#           We will call a positive number a generalised Hamming number of
#           type n, if it has no prime factor larger than n. Hence the Hamming
#           numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type 5.
